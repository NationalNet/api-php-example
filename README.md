Example for interacting with NationalNet's REST API (PHP)
=========================================================

First, clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/NationalNet/api-php-example.git
```

Next, edit the following lines and enter your mynatnet username and api key.

```php
$user = ''; // your myNatNet username
$api_key = ''; // api-key string found in myNatNet user profile
```

Now, you should be able to run the script. By default, nothing is printed to the CLI.
